# Bewakoof Clone

In this project we have tried to make a clone of Bewakoof Ecommerce Website And and added functionally like Signup, Login, Search, Cart page, Payment Page. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript Tech Stacks.

The product page of this website has functionlities like sorting, we can sort the products low to high or high to low,
in the cart page we can increase the quantity of the prfered product, we can remove an item from cart, we can change the size of the prodcut also, and we can apply a coupon that is "MASAI20" (not case sensitive) to get a 20% of on the total price.

This is a collabrative project of 5 members.

At last we are happy to see a working clone of bewakoof.com.
